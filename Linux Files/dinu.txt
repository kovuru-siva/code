usermod -a -G group1,group2,group3 exampleusername
For example, to add the user named geek to the ftp, sudo, and example groups, you’d run:

usermod -a -G ftp,sudo,example geek

@--fdisk -l  { this is is letter 'l' this file dont have a special permission}


vi /etc/fstab:


• The fifth field

specifies the option that need to be used by the dump program. If the value is set to 0, 
then the partition is execluded from taking backup and if the option is a nonzero value, 
the device will be backed up.


__The sixth field:

mentions the fsck option. That is if the value is set to zero, 
the device or partition will be excluded from fsck check and if it is nonzero the fsck check will be run in 
the order in which the value is set. The root partition will have this value set to one so that it will be checked first by fsck.f
If you face any troubles on mounting a partition, the file /etc/fstab should be checked for any misconfiguration.



dd if=/dev/zero of=file name bs=1024k count=500


field Name:

Description

Device

Specifies the device to be mounted. You can specify the device file or Label in this field. If mounted, you can find the related information from /etc/mtab file.

Mount Point

The directory under the root filesystem, where this filesystem will be mounted.

Filesystem Format

Specifies the filesystem type (ext2, ext3, iso9660 etc).

Mount Options

Refer the next link to learn about different Linux mount options

Dump Value

Dump is a backup utility. The possible values can be either 0 or 1. Dump use  this value to decide whether the filesystem should be backed up. If the value is "0", dump will ignore that filesystem.

Filesystem Check Order

"fsck" is a tool to check the file system consistency. This value determines the order that filesystems are checked by "fsck" program during the boot process. If the value is "0", fsck won't check the filesystem.




13. What is Virtual Desktop?

Virtual Desktop is a feature that allows users to use the desktop beyond the physical limits of the screen.
 Basically, Virtual Desktop creates a virtual screen to expand the limitation of the normal screen. 





16. How can you login to another system in your network from your system?

SSH can be used for this. The Syntax is as follows:

ssh <username>@<ip address>
cron and at.
zcat command




# mkinitrd -f -v /boot/initrd-$(uname -r).img $(uname -r)

To check the files in a particular date:

RAID 0:

I'm trying to stop a RAID disk in order to replace it by a new one, as this one is not working properly.

I'm typing mdadm --stop /dev/md1, and I'm getting an error message:

mdadm: fail to stop array /dev/md1: Device or resource busy
I'm getting this message even if I reboot the server, and I can't see a process that could cause this.

The server is working under a Debian with a 2.6.18-4-amd64 kernel. Could you help?

Edit: More details about what my colleague tried out.

After unmounting sda1, the command mdadm --remove /dev/md0 /dev/sda1 worked. But now, we still have an error message after mdadm --remove /dev/md1 /dev/sda5:

mdadm: hot remove failed for /dev/sda5: Device or resource busy

All of the above logs are generated using rsyslogd service. It is a system utility providing support for message logging. Support of both internet and unix domain sockets enables this utility to support both local and remote logging. You can view its config file by tying the following command:
# vi /etc/rsyslog.conf
# ls /etc/rsyslog.d/

In short /var/log is the location where you should find all Linux logs file. However, some applications such as httpd have a directory within /var/log/ for their own log files. You can rotate log file using logrotate software and monitor logs files using logwatch software.
